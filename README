These are my programs to solve puzzles on Project Euler website (projecteuler.net).
Every problem has EXPLANATION file which explains current problem and THOUGHTS file which contains my feedback on puzzle (maybe something about the code itself too).
Yes; code is messy, but i am only trying to solve puzzles.
