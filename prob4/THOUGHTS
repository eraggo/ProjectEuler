BEFORE CODING
Basically i need to find number between 10000 and 999999 which is palindrome, AND is product of 2 3-digit numbers. Thinking to split code as follows:
-Find out if certain input integer is palindrome separating 5-digit and 6-digit numbers. I am almost sure there is such 6-digit number so maybe 5 digits is no go.
-Find out if ie. number is actually product of 2 3-digit number (100-999)
-If both checks i found number

This format is just a test. Helps me think ahead.

AFTER FINISHING
It is funny to solve problems stage-by-stage. Breaking problem (and the code!) in smaller parts makes code more clean and wasily tested. I need to learn remove comments after function works tho...
